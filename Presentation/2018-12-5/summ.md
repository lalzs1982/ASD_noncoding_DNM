Analysis of overenrichment of DNMs in post-transcriptional functional sites
(details of data and method description please refer to https://github.com/lalzs1982/ASD_noncoding_DNM/blob/master/piDNM_ana.md)

updates including:

1, add CLIP RBP that are reported to be related to human disorders based on OMIM records (CLIPdb(OMIM)), 
breifly, 157 RBP recorded in OMIM were obtained from Castello A et al work  (Trends Genet. 2013 ), as a result, 7 of total 56 RBP from CLIPdb are related to human disorders.

2, for neuronfunction related genesets, I simply use 108 genes based on TADA predictions (FDR<0.2), rather than 2,555 used before

3, add new functional region: overlap between RNA folding (RNAfold) and RBP binding sites (RBP&RNAfold) in the WGS dataset analysis part
