Coding region DNM overenrichment that may not be contributed by codon changes

1, Data:
(1), DNM lists from several WES stduies of neuropsychiatric disorders:
(2), RBP binding sites downloaded from the CLIPdb dataset
(3), Potential functional mutation predicted by the RBP-var2 software tool
(4), Ribsnitch predicted by the RNAsnp software (p<0.05)
(5), damaging nonsynonymous mutations was predicted by Polyphen2_HVAR (classified as P or D) and CADD (phered score > 30) 
(6), genome-wide DNM rate was obtained from published work of #
and the coding regions excluding consensus splicing sites or splicing sites predcited by SPIDEX software tool (p<0.01) 
according to the ENCODE gene annotation was analyzed in this work.

2, Methods:
Rate of DNM for specified genomic regions (for example RBP binding sites) vs rest of coding regions analyzed (as mentioned above) 
was compared and the binomial test was used to estimate the difference significance. The expected DNM rate differences between genomic 
regions was calculated using the sum of point DNM rates across region.       

3, Results:
(1), Overenrichment of DNMs among mutations predicted as Cate1/2 by RBP-var2 in ASD, ID, DD, samples, but not in normal samples: 
a, for all coding regions:
b, for coding region excluding damaging nonsynonymous mutations:
c, for synonymous mutation regions:

(2), Overenrichment of DNMs among RBP binding regions in ASD, ID, DD, samples, but not in normal samples
a, for all coding region:
b, for coding region excluding damaging nonsynonymous mutations:
c, for synonymous mutation regions:

(3), Overenrichment of DNMs among predicted Ribsnitch regions in ASD, ID, DD, samples, but not in normal samples
a, for all coding region:
b, for coding region excluding damaging nonsynonymous mutations:
c, for synonymous mutation regions:

(4), Overenrichment of DNMs among predicted damaging nonsynonymous sits in ASD, ID, DD, samples, but not in normal samples
